## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms from scratch. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood without relying on high-level libraries.

## Dataset
This project does not include specific datasets. Users are encouraged to use standard datasets such as those from UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, or any other sources relevant to the algorithms implemented.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saketjha34/ML-DL-Algorithms-Implemented-from-Scratch.git
cd ML-DL-Algorithms-Implemented-from-Scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create a requirements.txt if dependencies are needed
```

## Usage
Navigate to the respective algorithm directory and run the implementation scripts. For example, to test the Logistic Regression implementation, navigate to the `LogisticRegression` directory and run the script:

```bash
cd LogisticRegression
python train.py
```

## Implementation 

```python

from Logistic_Regression.StochasticGradientDescentClassifier import SGDClassifier
clf = SGDClassifier(verbose =False, learning_rate= 0.01, epochs=1000, batch_size=32)

```

``python

from Logistic_Regression.StochasticGradientDescentClassifier import SGDClassifier
clf = SGDClassifier(verbose =False, learning_rate= 0.01, epochs=1000, batch_size=32)

```

## Model Architecture
Each algorithm is implemented from scratch, focusing on the core mathematical operations and steps required. This includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation procedures.

## Results
The results for each algorithm can be found in their respective directories. Sample outputs and performance metrics are provided within the implementation scripts and any accompanying notebooks.

## Deployment
This project focuses on the foundational understanding of ML and DL algorithms and does not include deployment scripts. Users are encouraged to integrate these algorithms into their own applications and pipelines as needed.
